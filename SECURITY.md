Please note that even if current releses are both for Kodi 18 Leia and Kodi 19 Matrix or newer Kodi 18 Leia add-on system uses Python2.
Python2 reached end of life (EOL) on January 1st, 2020 so the use of Python2 in not reccomended.
Kodi 19 uses Python3 so it's the reccomended choice if possible.
For user convenince Kodi 18 versions of the add-on will still be released, probably untill Kodi 20 beta starts, at that point support for Python2 and Kodi 18 will be dropped.
